# 🚀 CSE220: Data Structures - Where Code Meets Chaos!

Welcome to the wild world of **CSE220 Data Structures**! This repository is your personal adventure through the mystical forests of trees 🌳, the endless mazes of graphs 🕸️, and the crazy rollercoaster of recursion 🎢. 

## What's Inside?

- **Arrays**: Because sometimes, life is just a bunch of elements in one long line.
- **Stacks & Queues**: For when you want to "push" your problems away or just "queue" them up for later.
- **Trees**: If you thought family trees were complicated, wait until you meet AVL trees.
- **Graphs**: The perfect place to get lost while trying to find the shortest path... good luck! 😅
- **Hash Tables**: Because who doesn’t love a good hash? (We’re talking about code, of course.)
- **Sorting & Searching**: Like finding a needle in a haystack, but with algorithms to help.

## Why Bother?

Because you didn’t sign up for CSE220 just to sleep, right? You're here to conquer data structures, beat algorithmic monsters, and become the hero who can explain pointers at parties (because someone has to).

So, grab your keyboard ⚔️, take a deep breath, and prepare to dive into code that might just make you question your life choices… but in a fun way!
